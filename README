Solves the diffusion equation in a sphere with variable diffusivity.

### How-to

The library `yaml-cpp` is required to use the configuration file. The library and instructions to install it can be found at https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp

* Run `make` to prepare the executable file.
* Copy `default.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and update that version (to keep default.yaml clean)
* Then `./a.out` will run the simulation.
* The output will be `<run_name>-output.txt`, and located in the `out` folder.
* Code revision and relevant parameters are prepended to that file for future reference.


Examples of direct gnuplot visualizations are:

* `plot "output.txt" u 1:3 w l`
* `plot "output.txt" u 1:2:3 w image`


### Visualisation using plot.py

To run it: `python plot.py name N`, where:

* N is the number of profiles you want (evenly split between t0 and tmax)
* name is the `<run_name>` from which to read the data

The figures are saved in the folder `fig`.
