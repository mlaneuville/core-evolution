Solves the diffusion equation in a sphere with variable diffusivity.

## How-to

#### Dependencies

The library `yaml-cpp` is required to use the configuration file. The library
and instructions to install it can be found at https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp

To install yaml-cpp, OS X user can also use Homebrew:

* brew install yaml-cpp

#### Contributing

Before commiting please run `astyle --options=.astylrc modified_file.cpp` on any
C++ file that was modified. astyle can be found there http://astyle.sourceforge.net/

#### Running a simulation

* Run `make` to prepare the executable file.
* Copy `default.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and update that version (to keep default.yaml clean)
* Then `./evolve <folder>` will run the simulation (folder out/<run_name> has to exist)
* The output will be `out/<folder>/<run_name>-output.txt`.
* Code revision and relevant parameters are prepended to that file for future reference.

#### Visualizing results

Examples of direct gnuplot visualizations are:

* `plot "output.txt" u 1:3 w l`
* `plot "output.txt" u 1:2:3 w image`

It is also possible to use a python script for visualisation. To run it: `python plot.py name`, where:

* name is the `<run_name>` from which to read the data
* -n is the number of profiles you want (evenly split between t0 and tmax)
* -s <folder> is an optional parameter with the folder name (out/<folder>/)

The figures are saved in the folder `fig`.
